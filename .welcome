So this is the type of stuff that context-switcher will show you

It will look for a .welcome file in the directory and then display that information right here :)

If you don't have a .welcome, it will subsequently look for a README.md and display that.

If you don't have that, well then this ain't for your directory.

PS: It is advised that you add .welcome to your global gitignore
